<h1>Asteroids and Comets</h1>
<h2> Have you ever wondered about the different orbital classes of the asteroids and comets that have come close to hitting earth? If yes, check out this pie chart. </h2>

<p> The data in the pie chart depicts the percentage of asteroids and comets of different orbital classes. These classes include: Apollo, Amor, Aten, Jupiter-family Comet, and Comet. Together these titles make up the vast majority of the observed orbit classes and are therefore the most relevant when talking about comets and asteroids.
